    description: >-
      My expertise is at the intersection of experience design, 3d and cgi.
      Visually inclined and I believe code is the ultimate truth. You could
      model something in blender texture it and get a video out , but putting it
      on the internet and make it available for anyone to get a an out. Powerful
      stuff.
