      I'm a user experience designer at **Walmart**. I work with core
      supply-chain products. They ensure the right products are on the store
      shelves at the right time in the right quantity. Before that, I was with
      **Edge-verve** systems. I worked with finance and core banking products.
      Outside of work i like following tech news , big car nerd and likes riding
      motorcycle on weekends
