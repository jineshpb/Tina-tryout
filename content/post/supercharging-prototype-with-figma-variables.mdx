I worked on a platform project which enabled devs to create and maintain networks on blockchain. This is was still in its infancy and there were only a few tools which served this purpose.\
In short the platform allowed developers to create projects share their project and components (channels, smart contracts etc ) with their peers in the network and thus arrive at a consensus for any transaction, be it a shipping event or an invoice paid. \
We will talk about that project in detail in another post but I would like to elaborate on how I used figma variables to supercharge a clickthrough interaction\
so the problem in hand was to demo the onboarding process to the engineering team. The process is a complex multi step operation which was new to everyone. That was the time figma introduced variables\
I was thinking how to utilise variables to design the prototype with minimal art-board duplication\
Figma variables are no was perfect and im not endorsing it for anything other than simple prototyping tricks\
Anywayy here is what i did

Below is the anatomy of the page![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhuk11prd/image/upload/v1744633543/portfolio-tina/WBP/Screenshot_2025-04-14_at_5.54.52_PM_gmvwe3.png)

So I identified number of things that have to change state during the onboarding process

then moved on to setting up the variables. Its a lot and below are the variable groups

Im skipping rest of the variable details and letting you experience the click through. Entire onboarding flow was achieved with a mere 11 artboards\

Just follow the instructions on screen

Notice how you can come back to the dashboard/main page at any stage in the onboarding process and it maintains the state
