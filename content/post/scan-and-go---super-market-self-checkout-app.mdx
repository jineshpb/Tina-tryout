<PullQuote quote="Supermarket Queues Have OFFICIALLY Been Ranked From Longest To Shortest!" author="http://www.heart.co.uk/lifestyle" />

This headline underlines a significant consumer pain point: the frustration with long checkout queues. Studies have consistently shown that shoppers tend to avoid supermarkets with lengthy checkout times. Even self-checkout kiosks, while intended to alleviate this issue, haven't quite hit the mark in terms of consumer satisfaction. This presents a clear opportunity for innovation in the shopping experience.

## Introduction

In today’s fast-paced world, time is of the essence. The traditional supermarket checkout process, characterized by long lines and slow-moving queues, has become a major inconvenience for shoppers. This UX exercise is to enable shoppers to self checkout using their smartphones, it was done as a design challenge for my Walmart interview. There were bunch of assumptions made keeping future in mind, how the tech going to evolve etc.

## Understanding the Problem

I went on to Yelp to look at the customer feedback on various super market establishments

<FeedbackCard feedback="Just one girl on the register who doesn't care how long the line is she is there for her shift and works so slowly and figures that she gets paid whether or not she takes 10 min or 20 with your order. Not enough lines open and the self serve has never once worked properly" title="Cashiers dont care" rating={1} author="Diesel P" location="Levitton, NY" authorImage="https://res.cloudinary.com/dhuk11prd/image/upload/v1693151623/dkzdhm6gpmtkil1cxegs.png" brandLogo="https://res.cloudinary.com/dhuk11prd/image/upload/v1717156874/portfolio-tina/scan%20and%20go/Yelp_Logo.svg_l0nskq.png" />

<FeedbackCard title="Self check-outs do not accept cash." feedback="Went to the store recently. Seems not to matter what time I get there, there's only one human working a register. So, if you don't want to stand on that line, you go over to the self check-outs.	But be careful!!!	Some of the self check-outs do not accept cash." rating={3} author="Chilly A" location="Long island, NY" authorImage="https://res.cloudinary.com/dhuk11prd/image/upload/v1717163167/portfolio-tina/scan%20and%20go/rivage-jzz_3jWMzHA-unsplash_aj9dty.jpg" brandLogo="https://res.cloudinary.com/dhuk11prd/image/upload/v1717156874/portfolio-tina/scan%20and%20go/Yelp_Logo.svg_l0nskq.png" />
