<PullQuote quote="Supermarket Queues Have OFFICIALLY Been Ranked From Longest To Shortest!" author="http://www.heart.co.uk/lifestyle" />

This headline underlines a significant consumer pain point: the frustration with long checkout queues. Studies have consistently shown that shoppers tend to avoid supermarkets with lengthy checkout times. Even self-checkout kiosks, while intended to alleviate this issue, haven't quite hit the mark in terms of consumer satisfaction. This presents a clear opportunity for innovation in the shopping experience.

## Introduction

In today’s fast-paced world, time is of the essence. The traditional supermarket checkout process, characterized by long lines and slow-moving queues, has become a major inconvenience for shoppers. This UX exercise is to enable shoppers to self checkout using their smartphones, it was done as a design challenge for my Walmart interview. There were bunch of assumptions made keeping future in mind, how the tech going to evolve etc.

## Understanding the Problem

I went on to Yelp to look at the customer feedback on various super market establishments

<FeedbackCard feedback="Just one girl on the register who doesn't care how long the line is she is there for her shift and works so slowly and figures that she gets paid whether or not she takes 10 min or 20 with your order. Not enough lines open and the self serve has never once worked properly" title="Cashiers dont care" rating={1} author="Diesel P" location="Levitton, NY" authorImage="https://res.cloudinary.com/dhuk11prd/image/upload/v1693151623/dkzdhm6gpmtkil1cxegs.png" brandLogo="https://res.cloudinary.com/dhuk11prd/image/upload/v1717156874/portfolio-tina/scan%20and%20go/Yelp_Logo.svg_l0nskq.png" />

<FeedbackCard title="Self check-outs do not accept cash." feedback="Went to the store recently. Seems not to matter what time I get there, there's only one human working a register. So, if you don't want to stand on that line, you go over to the self check-outs.	But be careful!!!	Some of the self check-outs do not accept cash." rating={3} author="Chilly A" location="Long island, NY" authorImage="https://res.cloudinary.com/dhuk11prd/image/upload/v1717163167/portfolio-tina/scan%20and%20go/rivage-jzz_3jWMzHA-unsplash_aj9dty.jpg" brandLogo="https://res.cloudinary.com/dhuk11prd/image/upload/v1717156874/portfolio-tina/scan%20and%20go/Yelp_Logo.svg_l0nskq.png" />

#### Insights

* People hate queueing in front of the checkout counter and wasting time
* Most people hate the attitude of the cashiers
* People hate bad interaction with the staff

### Self checkout VS traditional checkout

NCR invented the self checkout a hundred years ago. Simply put self-checkout avoids your interaction with a cashier, instead you do the billing yourselves. A novice shopper without much knowledge about how the system works again delays the process.

#### &#x20;Deterrents

* The fear of making mistakes in self-checkout counters
* Working for free mentality is strong Most people feel they are working for free

### How Scan and go technology changed shopping in supermarkets

Early deployments of Scan and Go technology require shoppers to carry a handheld scanner around the store with them. Instead of going through the lengthy process of scanning items at the end of the visit, customers can scan each item as they put it in their cart. This allows them to pack while they shop and arrive at the checkout with a pre-scanned list of items, both of which accelerate the payment process.

### Benefits of moving to mobile

With mobile, retailers can push targeted offers and promotions directly to the consumer as they shop. For repeat customers, merchants can collect user behavior and purchase patterns to promote recommended products and remind consumers to pick up their frequently bought items.
