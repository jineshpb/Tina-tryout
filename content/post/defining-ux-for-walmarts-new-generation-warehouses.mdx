### Brief Overview

Walmart, renowned for having one of the largest distribution networks in the U.S., faced significant challenges with its aging manual distribution centers. This comprehensive effort aimed to transform these facilities into modern, automated centers, incorporating extensive hardware implementation, system planning, software engineering, and UX design. The initiative sought to enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and improve overall productivity. This case study outlines the UX component of this larger project, detailing its objectives, methodologies, design, and implementation phases, as well as its significant impact on Walmart's operations.

### Problem Statement

Walmart operates a vast distribution network, spanning a massive 151 million square feet and consisting of 216 distribution centers, including Regional Distribution Centers (RDCs), Food Distribution Centers (FSCs), and Fashion Distribution Centers (Fashion DCs). These centers serve as crucial nodes between suppliers and stores, handling the receipt, storage, and dispatch of goods just in time.

Despite some level of automation, manual processes remain prominent in these facilities, leading to increased turnaround times and inaccuracies. Specific issues include:

* Inefficient Manual Processes: High reliance on manual processes increases turnaround time and reduces accuracy.

* Labor-Intensive Operations: Significant reliance on manual labor for tasks such as receiving, storing, and shipping goods.
* Inconsistent Process Execution: Manual processes are prone to variability, impacting productivity and quality.

### Objectives

* Enhance Efficiency: Streamline warehouse operations through increased automation to reduce turn around times and improve throughput.

Improve Accuracy: Minimize errors in inventory management and order fulfillment.

* Reduce Labor Costs: Lower reliance on manual labor and associated costs.
* Increase Scalability: Develop a system that can scale with Walmart’s growth and evolving needs.
* Boost Competitiveness: Ensure Walmart’s warehouse operations are on par with or superior to industry standards.

### Project Scope

* Implementing hardware solutions provided by automation companies.
* Developing software interfaces to integrate with the new automated systems.
* Implementing ergonomic workstations with touch screen interfaces for problem resolution tasks.

### Research and Analysis

The project team identified key areas where manual intervention was still necessary, such as problem resolution during freight receipt. An example issue is quantity mismatch, where the received shipment does not match the expected quantity.

### Design

Adapting Walmart's existing design system to suit touch screen interfaces was crucial. This involved:

* Reconsidering font sizes, button sizes, and touch targets to ensure usability on touch screens.
* Reducing text instructions to facilitate easy comprehension, especially for associates whose primary language is not English.

### &#xA;Implementation

The automation partners provided the necessary hardware, while Walmart built the software interfaces. New fully automated facilities were designed to minimize human touchpoints for receiving, storing, fulfilling, and shipping items. However, ergonomic workstations with touch screens were implemented to handle rare cases requiring human intervention

The new system utilizes technology called ASRS (Automated Storage and Retrieval System). Which reduces the human touch point in receiving, storing and fulfilling freight for an order

Bots Store and retrieve Boxes/Totes instead of forklifts operated by associates. This frees up space between racks and increases density of storage.

Even though most of the freight movement is handles by robots, there are few things that need human intervention such as problem solving/error correction \\

There are touch screen interfaces in-front of the operator console to help him resolve these errors. Once these are resolved it can go into the storage like rest of the freight

### &#x20;User Context

The primary users of the new system are warehouse associates who handle problem resolution tasks. The touch screen interfaces and ergonomic workstations were designed to ease their job and improve productivity.

The project went live in March 2021, and the new automated facilities have been successfully replicated across the U.S. Key successes include:

* Significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy.
* Enhanced scalability to support Walmart’s growth.
* Improved competitiveness in the retail industry.

### Conclusion

The project demonstrated the importance of integrating ergonomic design with advanced automation. Key learnings include the value of user-centric design in improving operational efficiency and the necessity of ongoing iterations based on user feedback.
