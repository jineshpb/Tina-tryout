Don't be alarmed by the title, this is just for me to hide this potential NDA item in plain sight. \
HVAC/R technicians at wmt are either insource techs on wmt payroll or outsources to different agencies and they will be on respective agency payroll, There is a robust system to schedule rosters and manage workforce. Technicians are paid hourly and tracked for various activities such as travelling, fixing things, clerical etc. \
In 2024 we onboarded our first external vendor (Lets call them PE) who is interested in using the scheduling tool and tech tool for their HAVC/R systems. \
when we started the project there was a legacy grass root app for techs to discover work orders, but we decided to redesign it for the long term where there are multiple tenants on both ends, tech and providers. I lead the project and designed an MVP for external scalability and for internal usage
