HVAC/R technicians at wmt are either insource techs on wmt payroll or outsources to different agencies, There is a robust system to schedule rosters and manage workforce. \
then comes our first external vendor PE who is interested in using the scheduling tool and tech tool for their HAVC/R systems\
when we started the project there was a legacy grass root app for techs to discover work orders, but we decided to redesign it for the long term where there are multiple tenants on both ends, tech and providers\
